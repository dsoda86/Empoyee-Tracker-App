## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This application uses Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to allow users to access an employee database, view departments, roles, and employees; add a department, role, or employee; as well as update current employee information.
